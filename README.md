# The Self-Remembering Universe

This repository contains all formal materials, source files, diagrams, derivations, and simulations related to the ongoing research program titled **The Self-Remembering Universe** ‚Äî a recursive cosmological framework built across three foundational papers:

## Papers

1. **The Self-Remembering Universe I** *(draft)*  
   *Quantum Coherence Through Cyclic Spacetime Einstein‚ÄìRosen Bridges*  
   Defines a cyclic quantum cosmology grounded in loop quantum gravity, ER=EPR, and recursive entanglement structure.

2. **The Self-Remembering Universe II** *(in development)*  
   *Recursive Optimization and Coherence Mechanics in Meta-Configurational Dynamics*  
   Introduces the MetaCube: a computational structure modeling recursive evolution, memory retention, and attractor convergence through a cost-based learning functional.

3. **The Self-Remembering Universe III** *(planned)*  
   *Emergent Purpose, Observer Embedding, and the Logic of Existence*  
   Addresses the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of cosmological existence from within a memory-bearing, coherence-optimizing framework.


## Status

- ‚úÖ Paper I: finalized draft
- üîÑ Paper II: in active development
- ‚è≥ Paper III: conceptually outlined
