# The Self-Remembering Universe

This repository contains all formal materials, source files, diagrams, derivations, and simulations related to the ongoing research program titled **The Self-Remembering Universe** — a recursive cosmological framework built across three foundational papers:

## Papers

I - **The Self-Remembering Universe I** *(draft)*  
   *Quantum Coherence Through Cyclic Spacetime Einstein–Rosen Bridges*  
   Defines a cyclic quantum cosmology grounded in loop quantum gravity, ER=EPR, and recursive entanglement structure.

II - **The Self-Remembering Universe II** *(in development)*  
   *Recursive Optimization and Coherence Mechanics in Meta-Configurational Dynamics*  
   Introduces the MetaCube: a computational structure modeling recursive evolution, memory retention, and attractor convergence through a cost-based learning functional.

III - **The Self-Remembering Universe III** *(planned)*  
   *Emergent Purpose, Observer Embedding, and the Logic of Existence*  
   Addresses the “why” of cosmological existence from within a memory-bearing, coherence-optimizing framework.


## Status

- ✅ Paper I: finalized draft
- 🔄 Paper II: in active development
- ⏳ Paper III: conceptually outlined
