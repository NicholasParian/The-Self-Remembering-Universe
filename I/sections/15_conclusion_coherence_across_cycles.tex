\section{Conclusion: Coherence Across Cycles}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\subsection{Summary of Contributions}

This work presents a recursive quantum cosmology framework that integrates loop quantum gravity, non-Markovian decoherence, and entanglement-driven dynamics. The evolution of the universe is described by a transition kernel \( K(\phi, \phi') \) derived from spinfoam amplitudes, filtered by coherence functions, and regulated by entropy-memory constraints.

Key formal contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A first-principles derivation of the kernel \( K(\phi, \phi') \) from large-spin spinfoam amplitudes, embedded in a recursive configuration space \( \phi = (a, \varphi, \lambda, E) \).
    \item A recursive Lagrangian formalism that incorporates the entropy-weighted action, memory fidelity \( \lambda_n \), and entanglement-modulated kernels \( D(\tau, E) \).
    \item The fixed-point attractor \( \Psi^*(\phi) \), defined as the recursive eigenfunction of the kernel, governing long-term coherence and memory stabilization.
    \item A dynamical tension-entropy constraint, expressed as a variational condition, linking string-scale tension \( \lambda_n \) with entropy propagation and supernova thresholds.
    \item Falsifiable predictions for gravitational wave interference, CMB suppression at low \( \ell \), and parity-violating polarization correlated with void structure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpretative Framework}

In this model, each cosmological cycle inherits partial structure from its predecessor via coherence-filtered interference. Time is relational, arising from the flow of recursive memory, and bounded by the capacity of the system to maintain entanglement.

The transition kernel acts as a coherence selector, propagating only configurations that retain structural alignment. The attractor solution represents the endpoint of recursive filtering, defined by maximal phase stability and bounded entropy.

Relativistic limits are reinterpreted as coherence boundaries rather than purely kinematic thresholds. The speed of light corresponds to a point where waveform collapse prohibits further memory propagation. This reframes time dilation as a limit on recursive information transfer.

\subsection{Empirical and Theoretical Outlook}

The framework yields multiple predictions accessible to near-future observatories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gravitational wave interference nulls at spin-labeled frequencies \( f_j \sim \sqrt{j(j+1)} / (2\pi \ell_{\text{Pl}}) \),
    \item Suppressed angular power in the CMB spectrum at low multipoles due to kernel filtering,
    \item Scale-dependent non-Gaussianity \( f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{rec}} \) modulated by memory fidelity,
    \item Parity-violating EB-mode polarization in cosmic voids induced by entanglement decay,
    \item Recursive limits on entropy growth constrained by coherence tension and Hawking radiation balance.
\end{itemize}

These predictions distinguish the model from standard inflation and conformal cyclic cosmology and are testable by upcoming missions such as \textbf{LISA}, \textbf{LiteBIRD}, \textbf{CMB-S4}, \textbf{SKA}, and \textbf{Euclid}.

\subsection{Open Problems and Extensions}

Key areas for continued research include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Full Eulerâ€“Lagrange derivation for all components of the recursive action,
    \item Topological and gauge-theoretic extensions of the kernel with quantum group corrections,
    \item Microscopic modeling of the observer operator \( \hat{O}_n \) and its dynamics under decoherence,
    \item Numerical simulation of recursive evolution in minisuperspace,
    \item Identification of observable limits on recursive string tension \( \lambda_n \) based on entropy bounds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Closing}

This framework advances a coherent, falsifiable structure for cosmological evolution, grounded in loop quantum dynamics and entanglement theory. The recursive action principle, fixed-point attractor, and coherence-regulated transition kernel define a novel pathway for understanding cosmic memory. If validated, this model may unify geometry, thermodynamics, and information within a single evolutionary loop.
