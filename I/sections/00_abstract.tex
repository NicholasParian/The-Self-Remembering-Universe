\begin{abstract}
We propose a recursive quantum cosmological framework in which the universe evolves through coherence-filtered transitions between quantum geometries, preserving memory across bounces via entanglement-regulated interference. The model unifies three foundational principles: (1) loop quantum cosmology's discrete geometry, (2) non-Markovian decoherence regulated by an entropy-sensitive memory kernel \( D(\tau, E) \), and (3) Einstein–Rosen bridge thermodynamics as the channel of recursive information flow.

The configuration space \( \phi = (a, \varphi, \lambda, E) \) encodes scale factor, scalar field, memory fidelity, and entanglement eigenvalue. Evolution is governed by a transition kernel \( K(\phi, \phi') \), derived from spinfoam amplitudes and shaped by exponential coherence filtering and entropy penalties. A total action \( \mathcal{A}_{\text{total}} \) integrates geometric, informational, and decoherence contributions. A thermodynamic constraint enforces entropy–tension compensation: forward entropy gain must be offset by memory radiation and coherence stress. The recursive attractor \( \Psi^*(\phi) \) emerges as the unique fixed point of this evolution, with convergence guaranteed by a contraction mapping over Hilbert space.

The model yields falsifiable predictions including: (i) low-\( \ell \) CMB suppression from phase-filtered memory overlap, (ii) quantized dips in the gravitational wave spectrum from recursive spin interference, (iii) non-Gaussianity modulated by inter-cycle fidelity, and (iv) void-aligned EB polarization from entangled curvature domains. These signatures are testable by missions such as \textbf{LiteBIRD}, \textbf{CMB-S4}, \textbf{LISA}, and \textbf{Euclid}.

This framework offers a mathematically complete, memory-regulated alternative to inflationary and conformal cyclic cosmologies, positioning recursive coherence (not initial conditions) as the fundamental organizing principle of cosmic evolution.
