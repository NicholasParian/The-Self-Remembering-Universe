# Simulations for The Self-Remembering Universe I

This folder will house numerical tests and exploratory simulations related to:

- Recursive state vector evolution \( \phi_n \)
- Coherence kernel dynamics
- Entropy/tension threshold behavior
- Bounce modeling and collapse criteria

Simulations are currently exploratory and meant to inform analytic structures, not replace them.

## Planned Work

- Monte Carlo simulation of decoherence filter kernel \( \mathcal{F}(a, a') \)
- Parametric sweeps of entanglement variable \( E \) across bounces
- Entropy slope tests relative to memory gradient \( \frac{dE}{d\tau} \)
