# The Self-Remembering Universe I  
## Quantum Coherence Through Cyclic Spacetime Einstein–Rosen Bridges

This folder contains all source files, figures, and supporting material for the first paper in the *Self-Remembering Universe* series. Paper I establishes the theoretical foundation for a memory-bearing, coherence-regulating, cyclic cosmology grounded in loop quantum gravity and non-Markovian decoherence.

## Summary

**Paper I Objectives:**

- Define a recursive cosmological configuration space \( \phi_n = (a_n, \varphi_n, \lambda_n, E_n) \)
- Derive a non-Markovian decoherence kernel \( D(\tau, E) \)
- Introduce an attractor state \( \Psi^*(\phi) \) governing memory convergence
- Model spacetime evolution across Einstein–Rosen bridges using a recursive quantum field formalism
- Propose falsifiable observational predictions (e.g., CMB low-ℓ suppression, gravitational wave echoes)

This paper provides the ontological base layer for Papers II and III.
