# The Self-Remembering Universe

Welcome to the official repository for the research program **The Self-Remembering Universe**, an ongoing theoretical cosmology framework built across three formal papers.

## Overview

This project explores a memory-based, recursively evolving universe governed by coherence optimization, observer embedding, and entropic constraints. It is developed across three interconnected works:

1. **Paper I** â€” _Quantum Coherence Through Cyclic Spacetime Einsteinâ€“Rosen Bridges_  
2. **Paper II** â€” _Recursive Optimization and Coherence Mechanics in Meta-Configurational Dynamics_  
3. **Paper III** â€” _Emergent Purpose, Observer Embedding, and the Logic of Existence_

## Repository Contents
