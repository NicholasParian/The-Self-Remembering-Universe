\begin{abstract}
We develop a unified theoretical framework in which gravity, gauge interactions, scalar fields, and quantum measurement arise from a single organizing principle: recursive coherence constrained by entropy-regulated transitions across cosmological cycles. Extending the model introduced in \textit{The Self-Remembering Universe: Quantum Coherence Through Cyclic Spacetime}, this work formulates a recursive action $\mathcal{A}_n[\phi]$ over an extended configuration space $\phi_n = (a_n, \varphi_n, \lambda_n, E_n, \gamma_n, \xi_n)$, where memory fidelity $\lambda_n$, entanglement eigenvalue $E_n$, internal symmetry $\gamma_n$, and observer resolution $\xi_n$ shape the dynamical evolution of physical laws.

State transitions are governed by a non-Markovian kernel $K(\phi, \phi')$, derived from spinfoam amplitudes and filtered through coherence-weighted Gaussian constraints. A fixed-point attractor $\Psi^*(\phi)$ regulates long-term evolution by selecting symmetry-aligned, entropy-bounded configurations. Internal degrees of freedom are compactified along toroidal symmetry manifolds, and coherence tension determines the emergence or rupture of force-carrying fields.

We construct a complete recursive Lagrangian integrating Einstein–Hilbert, Yang–Mills, scalar, entropy-penalty, and observer projection terms. Gravity emerges from information-weighted curvature, gauge fields arise from recursive memory alignment, and decoherence is modeled through resolution-tuned entropy gradients. We derive falsifiable predictions including gravitational wave echoes, void-aligned CMB polarization, and variation of effective couplings across cycles. This architecture establishes a second-stage foundation for a recursive Theory of Everything and sets the direction for generalization to biological and cognitive domains in Paper III.
